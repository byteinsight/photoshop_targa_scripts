# PHOTOSHOP TARGA SCRIPTS

Simplify the steps to saving TGA paint files from Photoshop into the iRacing Paints folder.

### CREDITS

I need to credit Stephen Marsh who provided me with a working script at the start after I posted to the [Photoshop Community](https://community.adobe.com/t5/photoshop-ecosystem-discussions/scripts-for-saving-targa-tga-files-to-a-known-folder-location/td-p/13998437) forums.

### HOW TO

The scripts work on the basis that your working folder and file name match those used by iRacing e.g.

```
paint/car_folder/car_cust_id.psd == design/car_folder/car_cust_id.psd
```

To use them:

1. Copy the files to your Program Files\Adobe\<Your Photoshop Version>\Presets\Scripts folder.
2. Access them File > Scripts in photoshop
